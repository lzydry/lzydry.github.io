SoftEther VPN 5.02.5187 is vulnerable to Buffer Overflow in Internat.c via the UniToStrForSingleChars function.

To exploit the vulnerability, an attacker must utilize the vpncmd binary file and provide an input of 137 bytes to cause a buffer overflow condition, which will allow for control of the instruction pointer.
